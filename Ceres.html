Ceres, the largest asteroid and the largest object in the main belt, played a vital role in expanding our knowledge of the solar system. It is also the only dwarf planet in the inner solar system, which formed 4.56 billion years ago. Ceres is located in the main belt at a distance of approximately 2.77 AU, has a rotation period of 9 hours 4 minutes, and orbits the Sun in 4.6 Earth years. Ceres is considered an embryonic planet, which began to form as a planet but didn’t become a full planet. For an object to be considered a planet, it should follow some criteria: it should be nearly spherical, orbit the Sun, and clear its orbit of other bodies. Ceres follows the first two criteria but fails the third by sharing its orbit with thousands of objects. At first, Ceres started to grow by accretion of molecular clouds and tried to achieve hydrostatic equilibrium, but the strong gravitational influence of Jupiter inhibited the accretion of mass and its growth to become a planet. The lack of material around its region of formation might also be a reason. It is believed that it has a well-differentiated rocky core, a mantle with rich water content, and a rocky crust with a large amount of salt deposited on it. It is also believed that 25% of its mass is water. Ceres’ weight is calculated to be approximately 9.4 × 10²⁰ kg, which is about 33% of the mass of the asteroid belt. NASA’s Dawn mission revolutionized our understanding of Ceres completely. Before the Dawn mission, Ceres was considered just a static, icy, and largest object in our solar system. But the high-resolution images and data collected from the mission and orbital survey between 2015 and 2018 strongly suggest that Ceres showed geological activities and chemical diversity. The images of salt deposits on craters like Occator strongly suggest Ceres showed recent geological activity and indicate that there might still be liquid or briny water under the surface. The Dawn mission captured a cryovolcanic mountain, Ahuna Mons, which further supports internal activity. Ceres has no known satellites and doesn’t have a true atmosphere like Earth due to its low surface gravity (~0.27 m/s²), but a thin layer of water vapor surrounds it. This must be due to the sublimation of ice or vaporization of water upon heating by sunlight. The cryovolcanoes might also be the reason for the thin layer of water vapor; when the volcano erupts, salts, water, and other materials are spread above the surface. Spectroscopic data shows that Ceres’ surface is rich in hydrated minerals. In 2017, Dawn identified organic molecules, mainly carbon-based compounds, near the Ernutet crater. The presence of salts like sodium carbonate, magnesium sulphate, and ammonium chloride strongly suggests the possibility of water reservoirs because on Earth these compounds are mostly found near water-rich areas. Additionally, ammonia-clay rich compounds and carbonates were also confirmed. Mostly, ammonia-clay rich objects and C-type asteroids are formed in the outer solar system, so this suggests Ceres formed somewhere else and later moved to the main belt, confirming the theory of planetary migration. Ceres has water, heat, and organic compounds—the three main compounds essential for the formation of life. Dawn mission results showed no evidence of life, but there are possible conditions for some simple organisms to survive. The study of Ceres strongly provides evidence that even a small object can have internal activity and chemical diversity. Ceres has been one of the best contributors to understanding the structure and evolution of our solar system. Its differentiated structure gives ideas about planetary formation; the presence of cryovolcanoes and ammonia-clay based compounds strongly suggests the migration of bodies in the solar system. It also provides insight that water can exist even in small bodies of our solar system and suggests the possibility of basic life beyond planets and moons. Further analysis of Ceres might reveal more interesting facts about our solar system, and missions like taking samples from its surface will give more insights about its chemical diversity and past habitability.
